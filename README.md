### whatsapp_automate.py
This script is made for sending a WhatsApp message(currently set for Happy Diwali) to selected contacts from a given database. It uses the library pywhatkit for sending the message and sqlite3 for accessing the database. The database initializes itself when it detects none around it. The user can then add the contacts manually and use the database.
